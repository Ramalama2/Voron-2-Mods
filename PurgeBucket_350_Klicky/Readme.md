- Basically his design is already perfect, there is nothing really to improve on it. I just made a small Cut-Out for the Klicky (which you can do tbh yourself with a side cutter yourself xD)

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!

###### Bom:
- see: [Decontaminator Purge Bucket & Nozzle Scrubber](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods/edwardyeeks/Decontaminator_Purge_Bucket_&_Nozzle_Scrubber "Decontaminator Purge Bucket & Nozzle Scrubber")

###### Description:
- The bucket itself is v2.4 350 only compatible. I don't know and can't test the dimensions of a 300/250... But it's a dumb cutout anyway only.

###### Description (Only for Blurolls-Kit Owners)
- The Blurolls kit includes M4 Knurling-Nuts, that are a bit smaller and shorter as BOM (DIN466) ones. The difference is:
BOM-> height: 9,5mm / OD=16mm
Blurolls->height: 8mm / OD=12-14mm
- So for exactly this reason, this repo includes a modified Brush-Holder.
