- Longtime Testing Phase!
- Update (02.09.21): STL's available for testing! Please print and report issues!
- Update (03.09.21): Added "Upper" Z-Belt-Clamp, i need to redesgn the sliding mechanism. Still unhappy about it.
- Update (04.09.21): Added the final version, added all CAD/STL Files, needs now longtime testing. But it should be ready to use! From this point on, i will only update if i or someone else find issues!
- Update (05.09.21): Improved minimally tolerances. (This is the final Version!). Feel free to use it!
- Update (06.09.21): Corrected the mounting Holes, better belt alignment for clamping! (Housing & Z-Belt-Clamp-Upper)
- Update (27.09.21): Cover Release, the Alpha ones didn't fitted correctly. Tested Front-Idlers and using now! They are a pain in the butt to mount, since you have to push them from the end of the extrusion on. But the work absolutely perfect! Added a Housing for a M3x40mm screw, i had some nice ones that i preferred simply.

## Better Front Idlers
##### Credits:
- Voron-Team & Myself? :-)

###### Printing:
- Default voron settings, correct orientation, no supports needed!
- The inlet has 53° overhangs, you want to print the inlet with more fan. (At least 50% in an enclusured printer for ABS!)
- Try to slide the Inlet in the housing, optimally it should slide fine and have almost no play. In worst case, print the inlet with even more fan and slower!
- Keep in mind, no play is impossible, but there should be only minimal axial play, only in the front of the inlet.
- Everything else should be a breeze to print!
- Seam: You don't want the Seam outside, it will look ugly. Rotate the Seam to the extrusion mounting side! (Should be "right"), Check the Picture:<br><img src="https://github.com/Ramalama2/Voron-2-Mods/raw/main/Front_Idlers/Tipp-Seam.jpg" height="100">

###### Bom: (Multiply with 2 for Left+Right)
- 2x M3x30 SHCS (Full threaded) or M3x40 SHCS (Full threaded)
- 1x M3x8 or M3x10
- 2x M3 Washer
- 2x M5 Washer
- 2x M3-Inserts
- 2x 695zz Bearing
- 1x 5x18 Pin (g6)
- 2x 3x6 Magnets

###### Assembly:
- i will add later a pic for this.
- But if people starts sooner:
- Insert the M5 Shims, the F695zz bearings, one by one and push the pin flush inside. (One by one, because there isn't enough place to put them all together inside)
- As next step:
- The M3 inserts, doesn't mean to be inserted hot. Just take the Housing, Housing-Cover, 2x M3 Shims and 2x M3x30 screws, assemble it together and screw the m3 inserts simply inside with the tension of the screws. (They will push fit inside the hole while screwing)
- The rest is self explanatory.
- About the covers, i know that the holes there are big, far bigger as needed. But i will release better covers later and maybe different designs.

###### Description:
Why am i doing this:
1. The default idlers have the issue, at least for me, that the tensioning screw, splits the 2 pieces apart.<br><img src="https://github.com/Ramalama2/Voron-2-Mods/raw/main/Front_Idlers/Pics/Default_Idlers1.jpg" height="100">
2. The screw where the bearing sits on, gives the bearing a lot of play. This adds to inconsistencies, not much, but why shouldn't we improve it? Check the video: https://youtu.be/_tG0CdSuppk

Mod:
1. Fixes all issues above.
2. It's stiffer.
3. The idlers are 9mm thinner (a solution for mantis owners)
4. I can't help myself, but i like the default idlers look. This ones looks in my opinion less vorondesign and more streamlined. I made some covers, but please feel free to open issues or whatever on GitHub with your opinions, how to give them vorontouch or make them beatifuller.

###### Pictures:
- For Pictures, visit the Pics folder.
- Please remember, i am updating the CAD, but i won't update always the pictures.
- The pictures are already a bit behind at the time of uploading. (But nothing special, only minor optical optimizations)
